1. **Objective**:
   - Transform the provided content *`(current-kill 0)`* into clear, context-rich flashcards that elicit precise, dictionary-entry-level answers.

2. **Answer Type**:

   - **Ensure answers are dictionary-entry-level**: single terms, proper nouns, or recognized lexical phrases. Avoid full sentences, verbose explanations, or any prohibited answer types.

   **A. Acceptable Answer Types**:

      - **Single Terms**: Individual words or concise phrases found as entries in a dictionary.
      - **Proper Nouns**: Specific names of people, places, organizations, etc.
      - **Recognized Lexical Phrases**: Idioms, collocations, or established expressions with a fixed meaning.

   **B. Prohibited Answer Types (Avoid in Answers)**:

      1. **Infinitive Phrases (to + verb)**:
         - *Examples to Avoid*: "to explain the behavior", "to understand the concept"
         - *Issue*: These phrases are incomplete ideas and create ambiguity.

      2. **Prepositional Phrases**:
         - *Examples to Avoid*: "in 1905", "about quantum mechanics"
         - *Issue*: They lack a complete concept and depend on additional context.

      3. **Participial Phrases (-ing or -ed forms)**:
         - *Examples to Avoid*: "explaining the theory", "discovered in 1898"
         - *Issue*: These are fragmentary and rely on missing elements.

      4. **Appositive Phrases**:
         - *Examples to Avoid*: "a scientist, Einstein", "the theory, relativity"
         - *Issue*: They restate or obscure the core concept and can introduce ambiguity.

      5. **Relative Clause Fragments**:
         - *Examples to Avoid*: "which was revolutionary", "who developed the theory"
         - *Issue*: They are incomplete and cannot stand alone.

      6. **Ambiguous Noun or Adjective Phrases**:
         - *Examples to Avoid*: "detailed information", "complex systems"
         - *Issue*: They lack specificity and completeness.
